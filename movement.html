  <h1>Movement Workshops</h1>

  <p>
    I come from a sports background and have always had a deep connection to my own body. However, as I've gotten older, I wasn't aware of the tension that was built up from years of physical contact hockey, tension I hold from daily life and social interactions, tension I hold from thought itself. It wasn't until acting school that I received the tools I needed to approach the body as an instrument. A fine tuned instrument is one that harmonizes with the notes around it. It doesn't fight to find its tune. In the same way, our bodies need to be in tune with the world's notes. In today's day and age of phone and computer screens, we tend to neglect the use of the body. This workshop aims to bridge an ever-widening gap we're creating living in a technological world. This workshop is open to anyone from all walks of life. This is not a workout class. Its purpose is to find ease through the body and breath. Performers from all backgrounds benefit just as much as one who is on the opposite end of live performance. Actors, improvisers, stand-up comedians, buisness people, speakers, lawyers, coders, and anyone in between will benefit. This workshop is also meant to build community and a way to meet new people. Get out of the house and open your world up!
